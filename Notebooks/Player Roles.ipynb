    "This code loads the updated players dataset, cleans 'Headshot %' column by removing the '%' symbol and converting them to float type. Then it defines conditions for each role in a dictionary called conditions using lambda functions, which are applied to the DataFrame using the loc method, and assigns a role to each player in a new column called 'Role'. Finally, it prints the number of players in each role.\n",

    "    Entry Fragger: Players with a K/D ratio greater than or equal to 1.0, kills per round greater than or equal to 0.7, and headshot percentage greater than or equal to 25%.\n",
